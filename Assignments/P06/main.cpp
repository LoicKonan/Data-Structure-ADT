//** There are multiple parts to this program: What this program will	   //
// do is first and date class will be initialized to imput the current	   //
//date in the correct mm//dd//year format and in the date class, it will   //
//check to see if the inputted day month and year is valid and not over    //
//after this has ran through and validate, the date values are then        //
//passed over to the account class utilizing both the account.cpp and .h   //
//files being sent over and inputted in the private class of this account  //
//thus this will hold the value of the validated date. In the account class//
//the user is first asked to create an account(because you cannot do bank  //
//transactions without first creating an account first. Once the user      //
//creates an account, then the display menu will give options of deposit,  //
// widthdrawal, display account and such like a normal bank prompt would   //
//these prompts will then utilize the set and get functions to grab the    //
//user inputted values to be used for transactional purposes. Finally, in  //
//main function, the four additional files Date.H, Date.cpp, Account.h &   //
//Account.cpp are included in the inclusion up at the top so once the      //
//program starts, these four additional files will be able to be accessed  //
//due to the class call of Bank.MenuSelection(); and Account Bank which    //
//the account bank is just the database being ran by vectors to allow the  //
// user to imput as many accounts into the memory as they want			   *//
